# PyDoll Browser Event Loop Fixes

## Problem Summary

The Penguin AI assistant was experiencing blocking behavior and event loop conflicts when using PyDoll browser tools. The specific issues were:

1. **Browser Blocking**: When PyDoll browser opened in non-headless mode (`headless=False`), it would open a visible browser window that could block the event loop waiting for user interaction or page load completion.

2. **Sync/Async Event Loop Conflicts**: The tool manager was using `asyncio.run()` to execute async browser operations, but this created nested event loops when already running in an async context, causing deadlocks.

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**: PyDoll was failing to establish WebSocket connections (HTTP 500 errors), which caused navigation failures and timeouts.

4. **No Timeout Handling**: Browser operations had no timeouts, so they could hang indefinitely if a website was slow or unresponsive.

5. **Resource Leaks**: Browser instances weren't being cleaned up properly, leading to zombie processes.

## The Solution

### 1. Headless Mode by Default

**Changed**: PyDoll browser now runs in headless mode by default, only showing the browser window when debug mode is enabled.

```python
# Before
await pydoll_browser_manager.initialize(headless=False)

# After
headless_mode = not pydoll_browser_manager.dev_mode
await pydoll_browser_manager.initialize(headless=headless_mode)
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents UI blocking
- Faster execution
- More reliable in server environments
- Still allows visual debugging when needed

### 2. Timeout Protection

**Added**: All browser operations now have timeouts to prevent hanging.

```python
# Navigation timeout
await asyncio.wait_for(page.go_to(url), timeout=30.0)

# Element interaction timeouts
element = await asyncio.wait_for(page.find_element(by_selector, selector), timeout=10.0)
await asyncio.wait_for(element.click(), timeout=5.0)

# Screenshot timeout
await asyncio.wait_for(page.get_screenshot(filepath), timeout=15.0)
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents indefinite hanging
- Graceful error handling
- Predictable execution time

### 3. Proper Async Handling

**Fixed**: Replaced `asyncio.run()` with `_execute_async_tool()` to properly handle async operations in existing event loops.

```python
# Before (caused nested event loop errors)
"pydoll_browser_navigate": lambda: asyncio.run(self.execute_pydoll_browser_navigate(tool_input["url"]))

# After (uses threading to avoid conflicts)
"pydoll_browser_navigate": lambda: self._execute_async_tool(self.execute_pydoll_browser_navigate(tool_input["url"]))
```

**Benefits**:
- No more nested event loop errors
- Proper async/sync boundary handling
- Compatible with existing Penguin architecture

### 4. Automatic Cleanup

**Added**: Automatic browser cleanup after 5 minutes of inactivity.

```python
async def _start_cleanup_timer(self):
    """Start a background task to cleanup inactive browser instances"""
    async def cleanup_worker():
        while self.browser and self.initialized:
            await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
            if self._last_activity and (time.time() - self._last_activity) > 300:  # 5 minutes
                logging.info("PyDoll browser inactive for 5 minutes, closing automatically")
                await self.close()
                break
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents resource leaks
- Automatic cleanup of zombie processes
- Memory management

### 5. Activity Tracking

**Added**: Track browser activity to enable smart cleanup.

```python
def _update_activity(self):
    """Update the last activity timestamp"""
    self._last_activity = time.time()

async def get_page(self):
    """Get the current page - async version"""
    self._update_activity()  # Track each page access
    # ... rest of method
```

## Usage

### Normal Operation (Headless)
```python
# Browser runs in headless mode by default
nav_tool = PyDollBrowserNavigationTool()
result = await nav_tool.execute("https://example.com")
```

### Debug Mode (Visible Browser)
```python
# Enable debug mode to see the browser window
await pydoll_debug_toggle(True)
nav_tool = PyDollBrowserNavigationTool()
result = await nav_tool.execute("https://example.com")
```

### Error Handling
```python
# All operations now include timeout and error handling
try:
    result = await nav_tool.execute("https://slow-website.com")
    if "timeout" in result:
        print("Website took too long to load")
    elif "failed" in result:
        print("Navigation failed")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify the fixes:

```bash
cd penguin
python test_browser_fix.py
```

The test suite verifies:
1. ✅ Navigation with timeout handling
2. ✅ Screenshot capture in headless mode
3. ✅ Debug mode toggle functionality
4. ✅ Cleanup mechanism
5. ✅ Event loop non-blocking behavior

## Configuration

### Debug Mode Control
```python
# Enable debug mode (shows browser window + detailed logs)
await pydoll_debug_toggle(True)

# Disable debug mode (headless + minimal logs)
await pydoll_debug_toggle(False)
```

### Timeout Adjustments
If you need different timeouts, modify these values in `pydoll_tools.py`:
- Navigation timeout: `30.0` seconds
- Element interaction timeout: `10.0` seconds
- Screenshot timeout: `15.0` seconds
- Cleanup inactivity timeout: `300` seconds (5 minutes)

## Impact

These fixes resolve the original issue where:
1. ✅ Penguin no longer pauses when opening browsers
2. ✅ Browser operations don't block the event loop
3. ✅ WebSocket connection issues are handled gracefully with timeouts
4. ✅ Resource cleanup prevents zombie processes
5. ✅ Debug mode allows visual debugging when needed

The fixes maintain full backward compatibility while making browser operations more robust and reliable.
