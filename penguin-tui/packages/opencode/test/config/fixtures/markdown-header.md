# Response Formatting Requirements

Always structure your responses using clear markdown formatting:

- By default don't put information into tables for questions (but do put information into tables when creating or updating files)
- Use headings (##, ###) to organise sections, always
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple items
- Use code blocks with language tags for any code
- Use **bold** for key terms and emphasis
- Use tables when comparing options or listing structured data
- Break long responses into logical sections with headings
