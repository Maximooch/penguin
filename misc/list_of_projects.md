God bless us all! 

I had one like this July/August 2024AD, I'll fetch it and add it onto here. It was mostly breaking down projects it could do by language/framework. 

This one is going to be towards end results that could be used by humans or penguins (and future agents) in everyday stuff. 

Like LinkAI, or other stuff
