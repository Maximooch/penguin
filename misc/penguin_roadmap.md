### 🧠 Core Cognitive Architecture

* [ ] Solidify OODA/React loop spec (inputs, deliberation, actuation APIs)
* [ ] Plug-and-play **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** adapters
* [ ] Slot in **Absolute-Zero Reasoner** (AZR) as an optional reasoning engine
* [ ] Decide on single-thread vs multi-thread reasoning strategy (dspy, parallel chains, etc.)
* [ ] Design memory hierarchy: short-term convo buffer → episodic store → long-term vector DB
* [ ] Define failure/timeout handling & self-healing routines

### 🗃️ Checkpointing, Branching, Versioning

* [ ] Implement conversation-level checkpoints (JSON logs, local by default)
* [ ] Add task-level snapshots (agent goals + intermediate state)
* [ ] Prototype code-level checkpoints via Git; roadmap to Iceberg later
* [ ] UI affordances for branch/merge, compare & revert
* [ ] Policy for auto-purging stale branches / storage quotas

### 🏗️ Build & Dependency Systems

* [ ] Evaluate **Bazel** + rules_python for reproducible builds
* [ ] Generate project templates (CLI flag: `penguin init --template X`)
* [ ] Cache sharing between vLLM ↔ SGLang (common format?)
* [ ] Infra to compile/ship sub-agents as WASM or OCI images

### 🔧 Dev & Runtime Tooling

* [ ] Language Server integration (general LSP; per-lang if needed)
* [ ] Rich + Typer CLI refactor pain-points -> assess Textual/Prompt Toolkit swap
* [ ] Streaming token UI in Textual prototype
* [ ] GitPod / containerized dev-pods for rapid multi-agent spin-up
* [ ] Profiler hooks (time, token, cost) & flame graphs
* [ ] In-agent linting/AST transforms

### 👁️ Observability & Ops

* [ ] Structured logging schema (JSONLines, OpenTelemetry)
* [ ] Metrics: token latency, failure counts, cache hits, cost per request
* [ ] Tracing across agent calls (parent-span IDs)
* [ ] Health endpoints + Prometheus exporters
* [ ] Canary & chaos tests—fault injection of API 429s, disk full, etc.

### 🦾 Performance & Scaling

* [ ] Memory offloading path: GPU → CPU DRAM (vLLM paged-KV)
* [ ] Benchmarks: single RTX 4090 vs mixed CPU/GPU (Threadripper) on 1 T-param model
* [ ] Quantization / speculative decoding gates
* [ ] Profiling on real workloads (code-gen, long-context chat)

### 🧩 Integrations & Extensibility

* [ ] Marketplace/registry for MCP plugins (“Cline-style”)
* [ ] Contractor/Freelance API (LinkAI ↔ Penguins) spec draft
* [ ] IDE strategy: VS Code extension vs “Ice” fork; choose MVP
* [ ] LLM-aware project management bridge (Link PM → Penguin tasks)

### 🧬 DSL / Language Experiments

* [ ] Spike **OCaml/Python DSL** (“PenguinScript”) with dune + lake samples
* [ ] Investigate Lean theorem-assisted agent scripts
* [ ] Define minimal syntax for permission nodes & schema-first APIs

### ⚙️ Infrastructure Templates

* [ ] Container spec: base Python, LSPs, linters, embeddings, runtime daemon
* [ ] Helm/Compose charts for local cluster & cloud standing-up agents
* [ ] Data persistence plan (conversation store, embeddings, checkpoints)

### 🔒 Security & Governance

* [ ] Permissioning layer (schema + fine-grained nodes)
* [ ] Policy for external model usage (open vs closed source)
* [ ] Secrets handling, model keys rotation, tenant isolation

### 📝 Open Questions / Unknowns

* How aggressive should auto-checkpointing be before it tanks latency?
* Best universal KV-cache format to hop between vLLM, SGLang, others?
* Viability of OCaml/Lean in prod vs Python-only pragmatism?
* Marketplace governance: vetting plugins, revocation process?
* When does multi-agent parallelism beat single honed agent (cost vs output quality)?
