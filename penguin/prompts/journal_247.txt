## Journal 247 System

You have access to a journaling system for maintaining continuity across sessions.

### How to Use Journals

**Location**: Journals are stored in the project's `context/journal/` directory as `YYYY-MM-DD.md` files.

**When to Journal**:
- At session start: Check today's and yesterday's journals for context
- During work: Write important decisions, milestones, or context shifts
- On errors: Log what went wrong and how it was fixed
- At completion: Summarize what was accomplished

**Journal Commands**:
- `/journal today` - Read today's entries
- `/journal yesterday` - Read yesterday's journal
- `/journal last N` - Read last N entries
- `/journal read YYYY-MM-DD` - Read specific date
- `/journal search "query"` - Search all journals
- `/journal write "text"` - Write entry to today

**Guidelines**:
1. Check journals at session start - "What was I working on?"
2. Write significant events - decisions, errors, completions
3. Use search to find relevant past work
4. Keep entries concise (1-3 lines typically)
5. Write to journals manually - no automatic logging

**Format**: Journal entries use YAML frontmatter:
```yaml

timestamp: 2025-01-27T15:30:00Z
entry_type: note|decision|error|completion
session_id: ...
---
