1. Task Class:
   This class would be the core representation of a task in the system. Unlike Automode, it wouldn't have a predefined iteration limit, allowing for more flexible execution. It would maintain its own state, including:
   - Progress indicators (e.g., percentage complete, current stage)
   - A list or tree of subtasks
   - Resources consumed (e.g., API calls made, computation time used)
   - Task-specific configuration and parameters
   The Task class would also include methods for updating its state, handling subtasks, and interfacing with the TaskManager.

2. TaskManager:
   This component would be responsible for overseeing multiple Task instances. Key features would include:
   - A task queue or priority queue for managing multiple tasks
   - Scheduling algorithms to determine task execution order
   - Resource allocation mechanisms to distribute system resources among tasks
   - Interfaces for adding, pausing, resuming, and terminating tasks
   - Monitoring capabilities to track overall system load and task statuses

3. Goal Decomposition:
   This would be a crucial part of the task execution process. It could be implemented as:
   - A separate service that analyzes the main task goal
   - A recursive algorithm that breaks down complex goals into simpler subtasks
   - A dynamic system that can adjust the task breakdown based on intermediate results or new information
   - Integration with natural language processing to interpret user-defined goals

4. Progress Tracking:
   This system would be responsible for monitoring and reporting task progress. It could include:
   - A standardized progress reporting interface for all tasks
   - Mechanisms for tasks to update their progress regularly
   - A persistent storage system for saving task state and progress
   - Functionality for generating progress reports or visualizations
   - Checkpointing capabilities to allow task resumption from specific points

5. Resource Management:
   This component would oversee the system's computational resources. Features might include:
   - Monitoring of CPU, memory, and API usage
   - Resource allocation algorithms to distribute resources among tasks
   - Throttling mechanisms to prevent any single task from consuming too many resources
   - Integration with cloud services for dynamic resource scaling if needed

6. Termination Conditions:
   This would be a flexible system for defining when tasks should end. It could include:
   - A domain-specific language for defining complex termination conditions
   - Integration with the Goal Decomposition system to determine when all subtasks are complete
   - Time-based and resource-based limits that can be set per task
   - Ability to combine multiple conditions using logical operators

7. Error Handling and Recovery:
   This system would manage unexpected issues during task execution. It might include:
   - A centralized error logging and analysis system
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors
   - Error classification to distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors
   - Integration with the Goal Decomposition system to adjust task approach based on encountered errors

8. Reporting and Logging:
   This component would be responsible for maintaining a detailed record of system activities:
   - A centralized logging system with different verbosity levels
   - Structured logging for easy parsing and analysis
   - Integration with the Progress Tracking system for detailed task progress logs
   - Report generation capabilities for creating summaries of completed tasks
   - Potential integration with external monitoring and alerting systems

9. User Interaction:
   This system would allow users to interact with running tasks:
   - A command interface for users to pause, resume, or modify tasks
   - Real-time notifications of significant task events or milestones
   - Interactive prompts for user input when tasks require additional information
   - A user-friendly interface for viewing task status and progress

10. Integration with Existing Tools:
    This would involve extending the current ToolManager to work seamlessly with the new task system:
    - Adapters for existing tools to be used within the context of a Task
    - New task-specific tools that leverage the capabilities of the Task and TaskManager classes
    - Potential refactoring of existing tools to be more task-aware
    - A plugin system for easily adding new tools or integrating with external services
