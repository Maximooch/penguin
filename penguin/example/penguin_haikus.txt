Penguin Haikus

1. Tuxedo waddle
   Ice and snow beneath their feet
   Emperor's march

2. Antarctic winds howl
   Huddle close for warmth and love
   Penguin family

3. Sleek divers, they plunge
   Into icy ocean depths
   Fish become their feast

4. Midnight sun shines bright
   Penguins nest on rocky shores
   Life in extremes thrives

5. Gentoo, Adelie
   Chinstrap, King, and Emperor
   Southern birds unite
