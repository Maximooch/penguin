### `/zen` - Penguin Philosophy
**Category:** Educational
**Description:** Shows Penguin's design philosophy (like Python's Zen)

```
🧘 The Zen of Penguin

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.

AI should augment, not replace.
Developers should stay in flow.
Tools should be invisible.
Speed matters.

If the implementation is hard to explain,
it's probably a bad idea.

If you need to context-switch to use it,
we've failed.

Penguins work better together. 🐧🐧🐧
```

## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines

### Command Registration
All easter eggs should:
1. Be prefixed with `/` (except Konami code)
2. Not interfere with real commands
3. Be registered in `easter-eggs.ts`
4. Track discovery in config
5. Have optional `--spoilers` flag to reveal all

### Example Structure:
```typescript
interface EasterEgg {
  name: string;
  command: string;
  category: 'educational' | 'playful' | 'historical' | 'community';
  hint: string;
  execute: (context: CommandContext) => void | Promise<void>;
  hidden: boolean; // Don't show in /help
  achievement?: string;
}
```

### Discovery Hints
- Some shown in `/help` (educational ones)
- Some hinted at in error messages
- Some in comments in source code (meta!)
- Some in documentation
- Some require exploration
