# Phase 1 – Engine support for multiple agents
- Introduce an Agent abstraction (ID, its own ConversationManager, optional settings).
- Replace the single conversation_manager on Engine with an agents: Dict[str, Agent] registry, plus helper methods (register_agent, get_agent, run_agent_turn) so the engine can route work to different agents rather than the one hard‑coded manager it holds today


# Phase 2 – ConversationManager multi-session
- Swap the single self.conversation instance for a map agent_sessions: Dict[str, ConversationSystem].
- Provide methods create_agent_conversation, get_agent_conversation, and save_all to persist and reload per‑agent sessions.
- Names‑space session storage so each agent keeps independent history and checkpoints. This extends the current design that initializes only one ConversationSystem for all work

# Phase 3 – Message & Session data with a communication envelope
- Extend Message and Session dataclasses with fields such as agent_id, recipient_id, and message_type so every utterance is attributable and routable.
- Define a lightweight protocol inspired by frameworks like AutoGen (messages shaped as {"sender": "...", "receiver": "...", "content": "...", "type": "message|action|status"}) to allow agents and humans to exchange structured messages.
- Update serialization (to_dict, from_dict) and persistence layers to carry these new fields. The current structures lack any agent metadata

# Phase 4 – Agent‑to‑Agent and Human communication layer
- Build a MessageBus (or router) that dispatches protocol messages between agents and to human interfaces (CLI/web).
- Provide adapters for human participants—e.g., a “HumanAgent” that emits/consumes bus messages—mirroring AutoGen’s human-in-the-loop design.
- Ensure conversation transcripts can interleave messages from multiple agents and humans while preserving ordering and agent labels.

# Phase 5 – Multi-agent coordination
- Implement a MultiAgentCoordinator responsible for scheduling interactions, delegating tasks, and terminating workflows (e.g., round-robin, role-based, or plan-driven strategies).
- Integrate with the Engine’s agent registry so workflows can be kicked off via run_workflow/delegate_task APIs.
- Add hooks for advanced features like shared memory, conflict resolution, or hierarchical sub-agent spawning as needed.
