# Improving IDE extension message design

One thing I like about Codex (and Cursor does roughly the same thing)'s IDE extension design is that a response from the AI could take multiple messages, with the intermediate being hidden by default (but expandible/collapsible) with the final message being shown. 

This does maybe require some pretty big changes across Penguin, even down to its system prompt(s). But I think it's worth it. Probably look at this as a design system

What do you think? 

Any questions/suggestions?

### Short answer
I’m strongly in favor. It’s a great fit for Penguin and we already have a lot of the plumbing: the TUI renders `<details>` as expanders, collapses tool output in compact view, and streams “reasoning” separately. What’s missing is a lightweight “response thread” contract across Engine/Core → UI so each user turn can produce multiple related messages where interim steps are collapsed by default and the final answer is prominent.

### Suggested design system (minimal, incremental)
- **Response thread**: every user turn gets a `response_id`. All events carry it so the UI can group them.
- **Phases**: `analysis` (hidden by default), `actions/tools` (compact, expandable), `drafts` (optional), `final` (visible).
- **Event envelope**: extend current events you already send to include:
  - `{"type": "response_start", "response_id": "..."}`
  - `{"type": "stream_chunk", "phase": "analysis" | "final" | "tools", "response_id": "...", "chunk": "...", "is_final": false}`
  - `{"type": "response_final", "response_id": "...", "content": "..."}`
- **UI behavior (TUI/web/CLI)**:
  - Group by `response_id`.
  - Render `analysis` in a dedicated collapsed `Expander`; keep `final` as a separate, normal message.
  - Keep tool results collapsed with a preview; show a “Show steps” toggle that opens all interim expanders in the group.
- **Prompt shape (small change first)**:
  - Ask models to stream interim thinking as `<details><summary>Plan / Steps</summary>…</details>` and end with a clearly delimited final answer block (e.g., “Final:” or `<final>…</final>`). Engine translates to phases; UI falls back to `<details>` if phases are missing.
- **Persistence & prefs**:
  - Persist per-user defaults: compact/detailed, “show steps” default, preview lines for tools.
  - Keep collapse state per message local to UI; no migration needed.

### Why this is low-risk
- Backward compatible: if Engine doesn’t emit phases, the current `<details>`/auto-collapse behavior still works.
- Minimal core changes: mostly a `response_id` and `phase` field on existing events. Your `tui.py` already has most rendering and collapse logic.
- Performance-safe: TUI already trims older messages, debounces scroll, and collapses long blocks.

### Concrete next steps (small PRs)
1. Engine/Core: add `response_id` + `phase` to events; emit `response_start`/`response_final`.
2. TUI: when `phase=="analysis"`, stream into a dedicated, collapsed message; when `phase=="final"`, create a separate visible message within the same group and add a “Show steps” toggle for the group.
3. Prompts: add a short instruction to wrap non-essential reasoning in `<details><summary>…</summary>…</details>` and end with “Final: …”.
4. Persist a user pref for “show steps default” and tool preview lines (already in `tui.py`; just expose as settings/commands).

### Questions for you
- **Phases**: do you want only `analysis | tools | final`, or also `draft` and `summary`?
- **Visibility defaults**: should tools be collapsed even in detailed view, or only in compact?
- **Final marker**: prefer an explicit `<final>…</final>` tag, a “Final:” header, or rely solely on the `response_final` event?
- **Grouping affordance**: a single “Show steps” button per response at the top, or small expanders inline per section (current behavior)?
- **Persistence**: keep collapse state per message across app restarts, or reset each session?

### Small example (event-level; model-agnostic)
- response_start(`abc123`)
- stream_chunk(phase="analysis", response_id="abc123", chunk="Plan step 1…")
- tool_call/tool_result events (same response_id)
- stream_chunk(phase="final", response_id="abc123", chunk="Here’s the answer…", is_final=true)
- response_final(response_id="abc123", content="Final polished answer…")

This gives us the multi-message feel with hidden intermediate steps and a clear final message, while staying incremental and compatible with what you already have in `tui.py`.
