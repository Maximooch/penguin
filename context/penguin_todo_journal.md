Journal system will be a way of compressing (and expanding) context across multiple sessions, for truly 24/7 agents. That would allow Penguin to automatically

From June 13th 2025AD:


Write out how local Penguin helps with Link. Because I believe I can do it, mostly. Yeah pretty much the Penguin point is extremely close.

0. A way to describe a project through a text file and communication, 
1. breaking it down into smaller steps, deciding which context to prioritize over others (context folder), 
2. then delegating the Penguin agent to run on each task, 
3. and proving that it successfully delivered on that task through trustworthy verifiable rewards by it using the very thing it made (in cases where it's reasonable). 
4. The results will be in a version control like manner approved by the human. 

5. Throughout the experience of what it's working on, and what's being communicated, between Humans and AIs, the data that goes in and out, should be utilized to its fullest extent for learning. Just as important is the data being handed carefully for the User. More than just mere consent (that's often coerced in subtle means) is control. The User should control their own data, whether they want to share it or exchange it for goods and services, is up to the User. 

5.5 It will be assumed the User will at least want the Penguins to learn with the Humans as time goes on. 

6. Penguins will be like streams for rent (through the cloud, or own if being ran locally). This is when it's in 24/7 mode, with a general stream having branches it goes out of for tasks to then return to the general stream. 

The biggest thing here is general streams with task threads. I think that is the final piece. The final major ship. Everything else is just features and engineering. 

Probably a mix of "journaling".

==1118p== 

I think a mix of prompt templating with a time subsystem with the conversation system that allows for branching, with context being compressed through journaling/context folder stuff, and decompressed through agentic rag. 

Maybe call it Streams system? Experience system? 

==1132p== Information from each branch would (typically) need to come back as it returns to the general stream, typically the most worthwhile information to remember. Summaries? 

It's not require right now. But it feels like this is one of those features you should do now before more scaffolding. 


7. ==1139p== What is there to improve before Streams system? Project Management/Run Mode? MCP? Memory between sessions? Web interface? 

The stuff you can implement before this will get you to the point where you can use Penguin/Link to make it.


- [x] test run mode first
- [ ] Figure out #1 of the definition stuff
- [ ] Figure out the scheduler, leaving it in a 24/7 mode with it just working on what seems reasonable next is a pretty Penguin way of doing things. It's either how you start it or end it, probably both. But something to be done here
- [ ] Mostly prompting/tools
- [ ] Doesn't quite exist with the project management stuff yet
- [ ] any sort of version control paired in with project management also doesn't quite exist yet. 
- [ ] Link wallet is a whole other thing that I need to roadmap on. At least write about it.

Before Stream system, here's some more

- [ ] Web Interface
- [ ] MCP
- [ ] Process manager stuff

- [ ] Here's the point to do Streams
  
- [ ] rate limiting, budget management stuff, and more?
- [ ] VLLM/SGLang/Ollama/Transformers 
- [ ] Observability
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Interpretability!!!
- [ ] SEAL? (From the seal paper? Seems like I can get a bunch of inference while improving the model?)
- [ ] Cognition Suite

At least 15 ships, that I could do Saturday and Sunday? 

("streams")


1. A workflow that takes projects and writes a templated document formatting the tasks described to be added as tasks in the Project Manager system? 

Or Penguin could just read it and run those commands itself? 

I suppose both. 

I think there'll be a handful of workflows within the Link/Penguin system. 

I think this is mostly prompting though.
