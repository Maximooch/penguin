```

### **Database Schema (Core Entities)**
```sql
-- Multi-tenant workspace structure
Workspaces (id, name, owner_id, settings, created_at)
Users (id, email, name, avatar_url, created_at)
WorkspaceMembers (workspace_id, user_id, role, permissions)

-- Project management
Projects (id, workspace_id, name, description, status, created_by)

```

### **API Design Patterns**
```typescript
// tRPC router for client-server communication
const appRouter = router({
  // Project management
  projects: projectRouter,
  tasks: taskRouter,
  
  // Agent orchestration  
  agents: agentRouter,
  delegation: delegationRouter,
  
  // Real-time collaboration
  conversations: conversationRouter,
  presence: presenceRouter,
  
  // Integration
  penguin: penguinIntegrationRouter,
  webhooks: webhookRouter,
});

// A2A Protocol for agent communication
interface A2A_API {
  'message/stream': (params: StreamMessageParams) => SSEStream;
  'tasks/create': (params: CreateTaskParams) => Promise<Task>;
  'tasks/status': (params: TaskStatusParams) => Promise<TaskStatus>;
  // ... other A2A methods
}

// WebSocket for client-side real-time updates (bridged from A2A)
type WebSocketEvents = {
  'task:progress': TaskProgressUpdate;
  'conversation:message': NewMessage;
  'agent:status': AgentStatusChange;
  'user:presence': PresenceUpdate;
  'project:update': ProjectStateChange;
};
```

Based on Penguin's current v0.2.x capabilities and sophisticated context management, Link should integrate with rather than replace:

#### **Penguin's Advanced Context Management**
- **Context Window Manager:** Leverage Penguin's existing token budgeting with 4-tier priority system (SYSTEM, CONTEXT, DIALOG, SYSTEM_OUTPUT) as documented at [Penguin's Context Window Manager](https://penguin-rho.vercel.app/docs/system/context-window)
- **Conversation Manager:** Utilize Penguin's high-level coordinator for message exchanges and session management as shown in [Penguin's Conversation Manager](https://penguin-rho.vercel.app/docs/system/conversation-manager)
- **Memory System:** Integrate with Penguin's pluggable memory providers (SQLite, FAISS, LanceDB, ChromaDB) detailed in [Penguin's Memory System](https://penguin-rho.vercel.app/docs/system/memory-system)
- **Established API Surface:** Build on Penguin's comprehensive REST API and WebSocket interface documented in [Penguin's API Usage](https://penguin-rho.vercel.app/docs/usage/api_usage)

#### **General Streams Architecture for Long-Running Agents**
```typescript
interface GeneralStream {
  // Main journal for 24/7 running agents
  journalPath: string; // e.g., "journal.md"
  
  // Agentic RAG for information compression/decompression
  compressionAgent: {
    compress: (events: AgentEvent[]) => CompressedEntry;
    decompress: (query: string) => RelevantContext[];
    updateJournal: (entry: CompressedEntry) => void;
  };
  
  // Task branching system
  taskBranches: {
    createBranch: (taskId: string, parentStream: string) => TaskBranch;
    mergeBranch: (branch: TaskBranch, summary: TaskSummary) => void;
    getActiveBranches: () => TaskBranch[];
  };
  
  // Stream management
  streamManager: {
    getCurrentContext: () => StreamContext;
    searchHistory: (query: string, timeRange?: TimeRange) => HistoryEntry[];
    maintainContinuity: () => void;
  };
}
```

#### **Text Channels & Stream Integration (Future)**
- **Channel-Specific Streams:** Each text channel maintains its own general stream
- **Cross-Channel Context:** Ability to reference and pull context across channels
- **Stream Synchronization:** Coordinate multiple agent streams in collaborative scenarios
- **Context Inheritance:** Task branches inherit relevant context from parent streams

#### **Penguin's Core Engine Integration**
- **Unified Engine Loop:** Leverage Penguin's deterministic async loop for all agent actions
- **Tool Orchestration:** Use Penguin's existing tool management and action processing
- **Model Management:** Utilize Penguin's LiteLLM integration for multi-model support
- **Session Boundaries:** Respect Penguin's automatic session management and transitions

#### **Project Management Synchronization Strategy**
```typescript
// Unified approach given single creator control
interface UnifiedProjectManagement {
  // Shared schema between Link and Penguin
  sharedSchema: {
    projects: ProjectSchema;
    tasks: TaskSchema;
    dependencies: DependencySchema;
    streams: StreamSchema; // New for general streams
  };
  
  // Middleware for both systems
  middleware: {
    syncEngine: ProjectSyncEngine;
    eventBus: SharedEventBus;
    stateReconciler: StateReconciler;
  };
  
  // Link as orchestrator, Penguin as executor
  orchestration: {
    createProject: (spec: ProjectSpec) => Promise<UnifiedProject>;
    delegateTask: (task: Task, agentId: string) => Promise<TaskExecution>;
    monitorProgress: (taskId: string) => Observable<TaskProgress>;
  };
}
```

#### **Performance Alignment**
- **Startup Time:** Work within Penguin's <250ms P95 initialization target
- **Memory Usage:** Account for Penguin's <200MB baseline footprint plus journal storage
- **API Latency:** Align with Penguin's sub-250ms P95 endpoint targets
- **Stream Processing:** Efficient compression/decompression for continuous operation

## 🤖 **AI-Human Collaboration Patterns**

### **Enhanced Multi-Actor Conversation Management**

Building on Penguin's sophisticated conversation and context systems:

#### **Session Analysis & Context Management**
```typescript
interface EnhancedSessionAnalytics {
  // Leverage Penguin's existing conversation manager
  penguinConversationManager: ConversationManager;
  
  // Enhanced with general streams
  streamAnalytics: {
    journalSummarizer: SmallLanguageModel;
    contextRetriever: AgenticRAG;
    streamBrancher: TaskBranchManager;
  };
  
  // Knowledge graph of sessions and streams
  knowledgeGraph: {
    sessionNodes: SessionNode[];
    streamNodes: StreamNode[];
    crossReferences: CrossReference[];
    semanticSearch: (query: string) => RelevantNode[];
  };
  
  // Automatic categorization building on Penguin's context categories
  autoTagging: {
    extendPenguinCategories: (session: ConversationSession) => ExtendedCategories;
    generateStreamTags: (stream: GeneralStream) => string[];
    extractStreamInsights: (stream: GeneralStream) => StreamInsight[];
  };
}
```

#### **General Stream Management for 24/7 Operation**
- **Continuous Journaling:** Agents maintain compressed journals of their activities
- **Context Preservation:** Long-term context maintained through agentic RAG
- **Task Branching:** Temporary branches for specific tasks that merge back to main stream
- **Stream Continuity:** Seamless operation across restarts and interruptions

#### **Interactive Task Refinement with Streams**
- **Stream-Aware Human Input:** Human interventions recorded in the general stream
- **Context-Rich Collaboration:** Full stream history available for human decision-making
