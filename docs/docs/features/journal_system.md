# Penguin Journal Guidelines

## Before Starting Work

Check your journals to understand recent context:
1. Read `context/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today)
2. Read `context/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (yesterday)
3. Use `/journal search "topic"` if looking for something specific

## During Work

Write to journals when:
- You make an important decision
- You encounter and fix an error
- You complete a significant task
- The context shifts to a new topic
- User asks you to "remember" something

Use `/journal write "summary of what happened"`

## Journal Commands

- `/journal today` - Today's entries
- `/journal yesterday` - Yesterday's work
- `/journal last 20` - Last 20 entries
- `/journal read 2025-01-15` - Specific date
- `/journal search "Python"` - Find mentions of Python
- `/journal write "Fixed bug in auth"` - Write entry
- `/journal list` - All available dates

## Remember

📝 **Write It Down - No Mental Notes!**
- Memory is limited — if it's important, journal it
- "Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Files do.
- Text > Brain 📝
