## Architecture Overview

Penguin v0.3.3.3.post1 introduces an enhanced modular architecture with event-driven communication and advanced state management:

## Multi-Agent and Sub-Agent Workflows

Penguin's orchestration layer now speaks to both primary agents and scoped sub-agents so complex requests can fan out to specialized workers while preserving a shared context. See [Multi-Agent Orchestration](advanced/multi_agents.md) and [Sub-Agent Delegation](advanced/sub_agents.md) for deep dives.

- **Multi-Agent Conversations**: Every REST and WebSocket surface accepts an optional `agent_id` so callers can direct traffic to a specific persona or service partition. The coordinator keeps a per-agent conversation state while still exposing a unified system log and analytics feed.
- **Sub-Agent Delegation**: The core pipeline can spawn delegated subtasks that inherit the parent's tools, memory, and checkpoints. Sub-agents can be restricted to read-only or analysis-only modes and publish partial results back to the parent stream for review.
- **State Isolation with Shared Memory**: All agents share the same global memory store for recall, but runtime variables (current objective, active tools, run mode) are isolated per agent so experiments remain deterministic.
- **Client Support**: The Python client, REST API, and websocket streaming helpers all accept `agent_id`, enabling automation scripts or UI layers to switch personas mid-conversation without reinitializing the core.
- **Roadmap**: Upcoming iterations will add policy-based routing, automatic sub-agent scaling, and richer capability introspection so orchestration decisions can be data-driven.

### Core Components

- **`penguin.core`** - Central coordinator with multi-agent registry, event system, and streaming
- **`penguin.engine`** - High-level reasoning loop with multi-step task execution and stop conditions
- **`penguin.system`** - Advanced conversation management with per-agent sessions and checkpoints
- **`penguin.llm`** - Enhanced API client with streaming, reasoning models, and provider abstraction
- **`penguin.cli`** - Command-line interface with TUI, EventBus integration, and performance monitoring
- **`penguin.web`** - FastAPI server with REST API, WebSocket streaming, and GitHub webhooks
- **`penguin.multi`** - Multi-agent coordinator with role-based routing and delegation
- **`penguin.project`** - SQLite-backed project and task management with Engine integration
- **`penguin.tools`** - Extensible tool ecosystem with lazy loading and fast startup
- **`penguin.memory`** - Pluggable memory providers with vector search and persistence
- **`penguin.telemetry`** - Performance tracking, token usage, and diagnostics collection

### Key Architecture Improvements

- **Event-Driven Communication**: Unified EventBus for real-time UI updates and system coordination
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Per-agent conversations, API clients, model configs, and tool defaults
- **Checkpoint System**: Advanced conversation state management with branching and rollback
- **Enhanced Streaming**: Real-time response streaming with reasoning support and callback compatibility
- **Token Management**: Category-based budgeting with image optimization and per-agent tracking
- **Fast Startup**: Deferred memory indexing and lazy tool initialization (~2-3x faster)
- **Provider Abstraction**: Multiple client handlers (native, LiteLLM, OpenRouter) with auto-fallback
- **Configuration Management**: Enhanced config resolution with live updates and persona support
- **MessageBus Protocol**: Structured agent-to-agent and human-to-agent communication
- **GitHub Integration**: Webhook handlers for CI/CD, issue tracking, and automated workflows
- **Telemetry System**: Comprehensive performance tracking, token usage, and diagnostics
- **Engine Layer**: High-level task orchestration with stop conditions and iteration control
