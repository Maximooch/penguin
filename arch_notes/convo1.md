Maximus:
I am in the process of refactoring Penguin, mostly it's core.py file into seperate files for each specific purpose.

Here's the plan architecturally:

Break core down into smaller, more manageable files, with these files being in different locations. 

It should achieve roughly the same functionality.

Then change up the conversation system to be more flexible, allowing for user interuptions, maybe a change in UI is necessary as well so this could be possible. 

Probably something for state before long running conversations go about. Probably something to do with context and memory.

After this should be more support for long running conversations, does this mean context window management? Kind of. What does it also mean other than the Thought Message System? 

I think this is the point where, at the very least, it becomes a future consideration to be dealt with when it comes to server/TMS stuff later this week. 

I think then it's just a simple prompt for Cognition system. And a plan for fixing up the other systems. (Probably importhing stuff, maybe even trying out swe-kit, especially its codebase. I'd like to make a language map of it).

After that of course is web search, image support, local ollama support. Maybe a smaller competent model could be ran on my laptop doing stuff while I chill elsewhere. Like during dinner?

Before you respond with any code. I want you to ask clarifying questions about Penguin. This is to be as certain as we possibly can be that we are thinking on roughly the same page.

*Cracks open a Diet Coke while reviewing the codebase*

Let me ask some clarifying questions about the refactoring plan for Penguin:

1. From reviewing core.py, I see it handles multiple responsibilities including conversation management, API interaction, tool usage, and task/project management. When breaking these out, should we maintain backwards compatibility with existing interfaces, or is this a good opportunity for breaking changes?

2. Regarding the conversation system flexibility:
   - What specific types of interruptions should be supported? (e.g., canceling operations, modifying ongoing tasks)
   - Should the system maintain multiple conversation threads?
   - How should context switching between conversations work?

3. For context window management:
   - Should we implement automatic summarization when approaching context limits?
   - How should we prioritize which content to keep vs summarize?
   - Should system messages and declarative memory be handled differently?

4. Looking at the current memory system (memory/simple.py), it seems fairly basic. For the refactor:
   - Should we expand the memory types (e.g., working memory, long-term memory)?
   - How should memory persistence work between sessions?
   - Should we implement memory prioritization/forgetting?

5. Regarding the state management:
   - Should we use the existing SystemState enum or expand it?
   - How should state transitions be handled during long-running operations?
   - Should we implement state persistence between sessions?

6. For the Cognition system:
   - What level of reasoning capabilities are we aiming for initially?
   - Should it be able to meta-reason about its own performance?
   - How should it interact with the memory system?

7. Looking at the project structure:
   - Should we maintain the current file organization or restructure completely?
   - How should we handle dependencies between the new modules?
   - Should we implement a plugin system for future extensibility?

*Takes a sip of Diet Coke while pondering the architecture*

Would you like to address any of these questions first before we proceed with specific implementation details?

----

Maximus:


1. Could you elaborate on "backwards compatibility with existing interfaces"? I'm leaning towards breaking changes, but I want to know what you mean here exactly.

2. 

a. For now, just User interruption of LLM response generation, mostly towards when the Penguin is working on a task, and the User has a question, it can either pause/cancel what it's working on, then after it answers the Users question it can go back to what it was working on.

There could be some commands, like start, pause, resume, stop, restart. But these'll be implemented later.

As for modifying ongoing tasks, I think there doesn't need to be any special code for that. The user can say, as it could for any message "hey could you update this task to include x" and so it will. 

b. I think this is a later feature. For now it should have persistence across sessions, which I think includes a sort of large conversation log AND a folder system with log files for each individual session. 

c. as I said in B, later feature. 


3. a. For now it's summary messages, but Penguin may not be as faithful towards it. So perhaps a sort of summarize command, or summary message could be done? This would have to be using some 3rd party memory system and not Penguin's current `MemorySearch`

b. check @context_window.py . Generally non-system messages are summarized then truncated from the context window. 

c. Yes and this part is already done. Summary Notes are declarative memory, but they need to be retained across the session even after the context window is exceeded, not simply stored for the next message. This is partially done by registering summary notes as system messages


4. a. Firstly simple.py isn't actually being used in Penguin. But there does need to be some Memory abstractions for 3rd party tool use to be integrated with. 
b. good question
c. another good question

5. a. Use existing SystemState enum. Don't see any reason 
   b. Not sure.
   c. Seems like a good idea

6. a. for now just inserting a prompt geared towards its own reasoning abilities. As for where it's from? I think prompts.py could just import a `cognition_prompt.py`
   b. Yes, I think for now just including it in the prompt.
   c. not directly. 

One important note for the cognition system is that I think much of the `get_response` stuff from core.py should be in the cognition system instead, so it can handle general response stuff. 

For now it's just moving the `get_response` functionality from core.py to there, then later on something more elaborate. 

7. a. restructure roughly according to what was mentioned in 
@penguin_v1.md 

   b. import the various modules into core.py, which sort of acts as the nervous system
   c. Yes. That's a good idea.


Please ask some more clarifying questions. And also, tell me your understanding of what's going on and what to do.

Let me summarize my understanding and ask some follow-up questions:

### Current Understanding

1. Core Architecture Refactor:
- Moving from monolithic core.py to modular system
- Hub-based architecture for system composition
- Core becomes more of a coordinator/nervous system
- Cognition system will handle response generation and reasoning
- Memory system needs proper abstractions for 3rd party integration

2. Key Immediate Goals:
- Implement user interruption capability
- Move response handling to cognition system
- Set up proper context window management with summary retention
- Establish basic plugin architecture

Looking at the core.py file:

```249:324:penguin/core.py
    def get_response(self, user_input: str, image_path: Optional[str], 
        current_iteration: Optional[int] = None, max_iterations: Optional[int] = None) -> Tuple[str, bool]:
        ...
        try:
            self._prepare_conversation(user_input, image_path)
            
            response = self.api_client.create_message(
                messages=self.get_history(),
                max_tokens=None,
                temperature=None
            )
            self.logger.debug(f"Raw API response: {response}")

            # Handle different response formats based on API type
            if self.api_client.model_config.use_assistants_api:
                # For Assistant API, preserve the raw response
                if isinstance(response, dict):
                    assistant_response = response.get("assistant_response", "") or str(response)
                else:
                    assistant_response = str(response)
            else:
                assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content
                
            exit_continuation = TASK_COMPLETION_PHRASE in str(assistant_response)
            
            self.logger.debug(f"Parsed assistant response: {assistant_response}")
            self.logger.debug(f"Exit continuation: {exit_continuation}")

            actions = parse_action(assistant_response)
            self.logger.debug(f"Parsed actions: {actions}")

            action_results = []
            for action in actions:
                result = self.action_executor.execute_action(action)
                self.logger.debug(f"Action executed: {action.action_type.value}, Result: {result}")
                if result is not None:
                    action_results.append({"action": action.action_type.value, "result": str(result)})
            full_response = {
                "assistant_response": assistant_response,
                "action_results": action_results
            }
            
            self.logger.debug(f"Full response: {full_response}")

            if full_response:
                self.add_message("assistant", assistant_response)
            
            self.diagnostics.log_token_usage()
            
            self._update_task_and_project_progress(assistant_response)
            
            return full_response, exit_continuation
        
        except Exception as e:
            error_context = f"Error in get_response. User input: {user_input}, Image path: {image_path}, Iteration: {current_iteration}/{max_iterations}"
            self.log_error(e, error_context)
            return {"assistant_response": "I'm sorry, an unexpected error occurred. The error has been logged for further investigation. Please try again.", "action_results": []}, False
```

This `get_response` method should move to the cognition system.

### Follow-up Questions:

1. For the hub-based architecture:
   - Should the hub use an event/message bus pattern?
   - How should system initialization order be handled?
   - Should systems be able to discover/register with each other dynamically?

2. Regarding the cognition system:
   - Should it maintain its own state separate from core?
   - How should it handle partial results during interruption?
   - Should it have direct access to tools or go through core?

3. For the memory system:
   - Should we implement a memory interface/protocol for 3rd party integration?
   - How should memory priority/importance be determined?
   - Should different memory types (working/long-term) have different persistence strategies?

4. Looking at the current task/project system:

```464:489:penguin/core.py
    def create_task(self, description: str) -> Task:
        return self.task_manager.create_task(description)

    def run_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        self.task_manager.run_task(task, self.get_response)

    def get_task_board(self) -> str:
        return self.task_manager.get_task_board()

    def get_task_by_description(self, description: str) -> Optional[Task]:
        return self.task_manager.get_task_by_description(description)

    def create_project(self, name: str, description: str) -> Project:
        return self.task_manager.create_project(name, description)
    def run_project(self, project: Project) -> None:
        self.task_manager.run_project(project, self.get_response)

    def complete_project(self, project_name: str) -> str:
        return self.task_manager.complete_project(project_name)

    def get_project_board(self) -> str:
        return self.task_manager.get_project_board()

    def get_project_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[Project]:
        return self.task_manager.get_project_by_name(name)
```

   - Should these remain in core or move to a dedicated task system?
   - How should task state be persisted between sessions?
   - Should tasks maintain their own memory context?

5. For the plugin system:
   - What's the minimum viable interface needed?
   - Should plugins be able to extend the memory system?
   - How should plugin dependencies be handled?

*Takes a sip while pondering the architecture*

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect first? I'm thinking we should start with either:
1. Setting up the basic hub architecture
2. Moving response handling to cognition
3. Implementing the memory interface

-----

Maximus:

Only two things to clear up are:

1. context window and summary retention stuff is already done. It could be improved, but that's for another time.
2. Not sure what you mean by plugin architecture 

On followup questions:

1. a. no, too much complexity too soon
b. similar to how it's already done in core.py
c. not sure what you mean 

2. a. for now no
b. I suppose it could add the partial results to the conversation history, with system messages saying user interuption 
c. goes through core

3. a. Yes
b. that'll be for the 3rd party memory systems to decide
c. as I said in B, that's for these individual tools to decide.

4. a. dedicated task system
b. I think a simple database is better, or a json file. 
c. Good idea, write on this, but I don't think we'll implement it today.

5. For now just write a technical doc outlining a interface, and we'll just leave it at that today while focusing on the refactor.

*Takes a long sip of Diet Coke while organizing thoughts*

Let me summarize the plan based on our discussion:

### Immediate Focus Areas:

1. **Core Refactoring**
- Move response handling to cognition system
- Maintain hub-based coordination
- Keep existing state management
- Reference: 

```249:323:penguin/core.py
    def get_response(self, user_input: str, image_path: Optional[str], 
        current_iteration: Optional[int] = None, max_iterations: Optional[int] = None) -> Tuple[str, bool]:
        """
        Generate a response to the user input, potentially using an image.
        
        This method is the core interaction point with the AI model. It prepares the conversation,
        sends the request to the API, processes the response including any tool calls or actions,
        and handles task and project progress updates.
        
        Args:
            user_input (str): The input from the user.
            image_path (Optional[str]): Path to an image file, if any.
            current_iteration (Optional[int]): Current iteration number if in automode.
            max_iterations (Optional[int]): Maximum number of iterations if in automode.
        
        Returns:
            Tuple[Dict[str, Any], bool]: A tuple containing the assistant's response and a boolean indicating
                              whether to exit the continuation (True if task completion phrase is present).
        """
        self.logger.debug(f"Entering get_response. User input: {user_input}, Image path: {image_path}")
        try:
            self._prepare_conversation(user_input, image_path)
            
            response = self.api_client.create_message(
                messages=self.get_history(),
                max_tokens=None,
                temperature=None
            )
            self.logger.debug(f"Raw API response: {response}")

            # Handle different response formats based on API type
            if self.api_client.model_config.use_assistants_api:
                # For Assistant API, preserve the raw response
                if isinstance(response, dict):
                    assistant_response = response.get("assistant_response", "") or str(response)
                else:
                    assistant_response = str(response)
            else:
                assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content
                
            exit_continuation = TASK_COMPLETION_PHRASE in str(assistant_response)
            
            self.logger.debug(f"Parsed assistant response: {assistant_response}")
            self.logger.debug(f"Exit continuation: {exit_continuation}")

            actions = parse_action(assistant_response)
            self.logger.debug(f"Parsed actions: {actions}")

            action_results = []
            for action in actions:
                result = self.action_executor.execute_action(action)
                self.logger.debug(f"Action executed: {action.action_type.value}, Result: {result}")
                if result is not None:
                    action_results.append({"action": action.action_type.value, "result": str(result)})
            full_response = {
                "assistant_response": assistant_response,
                "action_results": action_results
            }
            
            self.logger.debug(f"Full response: {full_response}")

            if full_response:
                self.add_message("assistant", assistant_response)
            
            self.diagnostics.log_token_usage()
            
            self._update_task_and_project_progress(assistant_response)
            
            return full_response, exit_continuation

            return {"assistant_response": "I'm sorry, an unexpected error occurred. The error has been logged for further investigation. Please try again.", "action_results": []}, False
```


2. **Memory System**
- Create interface for 3rd party memory systems
- Keep existing context window management
- Reference:

```1:15:penguin/memory/context_window.py
# Class to handle context windows. 
# Handles truncation through summarization and relevance to maintain context within a set limit. 
# Keeps system messages out of the truncation. 

# Should be modular in general according to Penguin standards. 


# truncate non system messages when context window is exceeded. this will newly include summary notes in order to maintain context within the window. 

# summary notes will work similar to declarative memory, but only for the session. After the session is over, the summary notes will be archived.


from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple
from .summary_notes import SummaryNotes
from llm.model_config import ModelConfig
```


3. **Task System**
- Move to dedicated system
- Implement simple JSON/DB persistence
- Reference:

```464:489:penguin/core.py
    def create_task(self, description: str) -> Task:
        return self.task_manager.create_task(description)

    def run_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        self.task_manager.run_task(task, self.get_response)

    def get_task_board(self) -> str:
        return self.task_manager.get_task_board()

    def get_task_by_description(self, description: str) -> Optional[Task]:
        return self.task_manager.get_task_by_description(description)

    def create_project(self, name: str, description: str) -> Project:
        return self.task_manager.create_project(name, description)
    def run_project(self, project: Project) -> None:
        self.task_manager.run_project(project, self.get_response)

    def complete_project(self, project_name: str) -> str:
        return self.task_manager.complete_project(project_name)

    def get_project_board(self) -> str:
        return self.task_manager.get_project_board()

    def get_project_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[Project]:
        return self.task_manager.get_project_by_name(name)
```


### Follow-up Question:
For the memory system interface, should we:
1. Define a base class with required methods?
2. Use a protocol/abstract base class?
3. Keep it simple with just function signatures?

Would you like me to start with:
1. Technical doc for plugin interface
2. Memory system interface
3. Moving response handling to cognition
4. Task system separation
