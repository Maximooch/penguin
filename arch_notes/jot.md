God bless us all! 

Laptop is being weird, body wants to lie down on couch. It's almost 12. 

Only thing left OpenAI wise is making sure conversation history works in a more logical manner. I mean it's more or less the entire point of it. 

Then it's figuring out how a stateful api could be applied to other models, hopefully ones that aren't just locally hosted.


1. Then it's the Penguin server.
2. Thought Message System(s). 
3. Cognitive Architecture and configurability. Groundwork I suppose

4. various systems. Mostly around Cognition and Memory. Though I suppose there could be a rewrite in the form of new systems coming together.
    a. Cognition, mostly for a PiD loop, semantic entrophy stuff. 
    the relation between Cognition and Memory is one I'm not sure of. From managing context windows, contextual awareness, and especially cognitive operations/properties, like a language map.
    b. Memory. 
    - Memory Search
    


    c. Processor
    - Parser
    - Utils
    - Base Tools
    To an extent, there's parsing the actual stuff, and then there's code generators, tooling system, I suppose tooling could be its own system.

    d. System
    - Base Program
    - Server
    - Thought Message System?

    Could be though of as a bridge for the Brain. Perhaps also its communication network.

    A bridge.py where everything can come together like lego blocks would be cool. 

    e. Tooling
    - Mostly integrations and further tooling



    This will be a cognitive architecture, one of the first virtual brains that'll be in production and commercial (among many other things)... But it can also be a regular library. Maybe an additional system for the base library? Could be a seperate thing though. Maybe.

    What about the Agent system? And its relation to Link/Workspace? This is all very much theoretical 


    As for OAK?
